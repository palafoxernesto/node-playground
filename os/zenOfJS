Zen Of Javascript
 
Build functionality, not architecture.
Build small things that work
and glue them together to make big things.
Clear is better than clever,
but graceful beats both.
Comments are good, even if you're Dutch.
Asychronous is better than synchronous
except for when it isn't
but your code should work on both.
Convention is better than definition,
if you have good docs.
Keep it loose, but build good tests
